# Liquid Crystal Variable Retarder Controller (LCVR)

The LCVR device introduces a phase shift to compensate for the phase shift from the dichroic mirror in the 
fluorescence microscopy system with structured illumination. With this device, the illumination pattern can
be fine-tuned to its ideal state resulting in the microscope sytem attaining a higher resolution image.
